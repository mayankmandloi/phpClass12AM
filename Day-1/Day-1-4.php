PHP has a total of eight data types which we use to construct our variables −

    Integers − are whole numbers, without a decimal point, like 4195.

    Doubles − are floating-point numbers, like 3.14159 or 49.1.

    Booleans − have only two possible values either true or false.

    NULL − is a special type that only has one value: NULL.

    Strings − are sequences of characters, like 'PHP supports string operations.'

    Arrays − are named and indexed collections of other values.

    Objects − are instances of programmer-defined classes, which can package up both other kinds of values and functions that are specific to the class.

    Resources − are special variables that hold references to resources external to PHP (such as database connections).
